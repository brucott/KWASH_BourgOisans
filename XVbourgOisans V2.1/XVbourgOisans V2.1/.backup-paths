# Backup definition file. Paths can be absolute or relative to the folder containing this file.
# Each line in this file defines a file or files to be included in the backup and is in the format:
# 'path/to/file/to/back/up'
# Optionally you can specify how symlinks should be handled:
#   symlinks=no-dereference (default if symlink handling is not specified)
#   symlinks=dereference
#   symlinks=ignore
# e.g 'path/to/file/to/back/up';symlinks=dereference
# Paths can contain wildcards '*' or '?', all other characters are treated literally. Paths containing literal symbols *, ?, \, ' are not supported.
